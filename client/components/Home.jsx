        Programming is a universe itself yet to discover... Here, I am tracking my growth as a developer. <br/>
        To start, I will have links to some of my practice projects and some research about human skills I practice while I code along. <br />
        Eventually I will write down how and why I solved coding problems every day, and reveal hurdles in my workflow. <br/>
        I am having so much in this learning journey! ((  ͡• ʖ  ͡• )) <br />
